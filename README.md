Next generation mocking for PHP 7!

This is a library created by Daniel Karp and Dave Marshall in our quasi-weekly pair
coding sessions.

It started out as an exercise in tightening and standardising the API to
mockery, but quickly spawned it's own name and direction. 

It's not ready for the prime time yet, but we're working on it, very slowly, in
half hour sessions whenever we get time.
